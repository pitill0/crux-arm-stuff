# crux-arm-stuff

` Note: This repository is intended for personal use. While it is public, its primary purpose is to serve as a personal workspace for organizing resources and documentation related to ARM development. Please consider this when browsing or contributing.`

This repository is intended as a workspace for collecting and organizing information, scripts, and resources related to working with ARM-based devices using the CRUX-ARM ecosystem.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to serve as a central hub for:

- Documentation and notes about ARM kernels (compilation, configuration, and optimization for specific 
  devices)

- U-Boot bootloader resources (building, configuring, and deploying U-Boot on ARM platforms)

- Docker containerization for ARM (creating and managing Docker images to facilitate development, testing, 
    and deployment on ARM devices)

- Guides and scripts for building and maintaining a CRUX-ARM environment.

This repository is especially focused on enabling a smooth workflow for building, deploying, and experimenting with ARM kernels, U-Boot, and Docker images-primarily targeting CRUX-ARM and similar lightweight Linux distributions for ARM hardware


## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- Step-by-step guides for compiling and installing custom kernels for ARM devices

- Instructions and scripts for building U-Boot, including containerized build environments

- Dockerfiles and helper scripts to create ARM-compatible containers for development and testing

- Notes, troubleshooting tips, and best practices for working with CRUX-ARM, kernels, and bootloaders

- Example configurations and build recipes for popular ARM boards

## Target Audience

This repository is intended for:

- Developers and hobbyists working with ARM devices and CRUX-ARM

- Anyone interested in compiling custom kernels or U-Boot for ARM hardware

- Users looking to leverage Docker for ARM development and deployment

## Contribution

Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have relevant scripts, documentation, or tips to share.

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated as new resources and documentation become available.
